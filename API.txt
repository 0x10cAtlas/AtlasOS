Function calls
==============

All functions with three (3) or less parameters use fastcall. This means the parameters
are not pushed on the stack. Instead they are kept in the A, B and C registers.
The result is stored in A if not defined in this document.

Functions with more then three parameters expect them to be pushed on the stack in a
reversed order.

Less then three params
C:
	int add(int x, int y) {
		return x+y;
	}

ASM:
	ADD A, B
	SET PC, POP
	
More then three params
C:
	int add(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
		return a+b+c+d;
	}
	
ASM:
	SET PUSH, B
	
	SET A, SP
	SUB A, 2
	SET B, [A]	; SET d
	SUB A, 1
	ADD B, [A]  ; ADD c
	SUB A, 1
	ADD B, [A]  ; ADD b
	SUB A, 1
	ADD B, [A]  ; ADD a
	
	SET A, B    ; Return
	SET B, POP
	SET PC, POP
