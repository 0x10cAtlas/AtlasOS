----- Introduction -----

The virtual file system (VFS) allows you to pre-load AtlasOS with files, at
least until real storage becomes widely available for DCPU-16 emulators.

VFS Builder is a quick way to create the VFS (which is basically an assembly
file which is included alongside the kernel) by looking at a given directory
and indexing the files and subdirectories in it, then looking at each file in
turn and creating the assembly code equivalent (i.e. a lot of dats and hex).

Python is required to use this script (tested on 3.0, although should work on
earlier versions to).


----- Usage -----

python utilities/vfsbuilder/vfsbuilder.py
Options:
	-a, --atlas:	Define the AtlasOS directory
	-r, --root:	Define the directory to convert to the VFS

By default, VFS Builder assumes that it is being executed from the AtlasOS
directory will look to compile for the directory misc/vfs. If this is not the
case the above options will need to be used.


----- Using VFS Builder as a Library -----

If you wish to hack the VFS, you may find it useful to use VFS Builder as a
Python library. The classes and methods are somewhat general and relatively
well documented. The main function can be used as a good example of how to use
them.
